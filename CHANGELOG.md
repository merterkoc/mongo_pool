# 1.4.2

- Mongo dart package version update

# 1.4.1

- *(Breaking changes mongo_dart!)*
  Updated Bson, Mongo_dart_query and Uuid dependencies, this leads to a series of Breaking changes.
  Please, see the respective github pages for details, here a recap of the most noticeable:
  BSON classes are mainly used for internal use. See the Bson github site for more details
  BsonRegexp now it is not normally needed, use RegExp instead.
  BsonNull is not needed, you can use null directly.
  A new JsCode class has been created, it is no more needed the use of BsonCode.
  a DbRef class has been created. The old version was storing DbPointer and DbRef the same way. Now
  they are separated as in Bson specification. If you have old data, please consider this change.
  Uuid dependency has been updated and you have to consider that the UuidValue class has been
  slightly changed. The .fromString constructure must be used mainly instead of the default one.
  Check the Uuid package github site for details.
